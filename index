## Prompt: Comment on using a switch in JavaScript. 


Like any other programming language, JavaScript is capable of flow control. Nearly every app or program in use today utilizes flow control via if or while statements. These are

great when you have only a few logical checks to perform. The if … else statement comes in handy if you’d like to check on the presence of a certain condition. Likewise, when the initial condition is not present, the else statement gives you control over managing the other side of the coin. If the weather is nice, tell the app to produce a statement that says, “Enjoy the sun and sand!” Otherwise, if the weather is not great, the app will produce a statement that says, “Keep your layers handy and have a warm beverage.” 

```
var weather = [some value]; 

if (weather === “sunny”) { 
  alert(“Enjoy the sun and sand!”); 
} else { 
  alert(“Keep your layers handy and have a warm beverage.”); 
}
```

The initial if check is verbose and tells you exactly what it is looking for. However, the else statement is rather open-ended. Here, else will catch any condition where the weather variable doesn’t equal ‘sunny.’ The else statement is a catch-all and guarantees a recommendation to keep one’s layers handy unless it is sunny. 

Consider if you had five or more if checks, denoted with four else … if statements. It would work, but it would start to become very repetitive. In this case, it would be easier to use a switch statement. These are useful for times when you are checking on numerous unique conditions. 

```
switch (weather) { 
  case ‘weather outcome 1’: 
    [action]; 
    break; 
  case ‘weather outcome 2’: 
    [action]; 
    break; 
  case ‘weather outcome 3’: 
    [action]; 
    break; 
  case ‘weather outcome 4’: 
    [action]; 
    break; 
  default: 
    [action]; 
    break; 
}
```
 
Each case statement mirrors an individual if check, but the syntax here is cleaner because there is only one statement that requires a variable. The switch statement allows for numerous checks without repeating oneself. The break statements come into play only when the case fires. The default case will fire if none of the cases that come before it fire. 

If printing something out or alerting the user isn’t the result you’re looking for, you can also use that case to assign a pertinent value or tell another part of the program what it needs to know. Switches are used in React Redux to minimize code use and make reducer functions as D.R.Y. as possible. D.R.Y. just means don’t repeat yourself and is the main factor in minimizing boilerplate code volume.
